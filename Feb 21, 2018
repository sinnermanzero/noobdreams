Today is day one (well, not really) of my attempt to keep track of my progress.
I have completed the HTML and CSS sections of FreeCodeCamp(FCC). 
However, as I was utterly uninitiated to the web development/coding/programming/hacking world before this point, I decided to
start the FREEEEEE session for HTML on Codeacademy.
I have finished the 1st two free lessons today.
Next lesson is Tables. 
Will leave that for tomorrow.
